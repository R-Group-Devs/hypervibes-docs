A HyperVIBES realm is an isolated environment with a specific ERC-20 token and various configuration options. Anybody is free to create a realm for their own experiments, protocols, and projects.

### How do I create a realm?

The HyperVIBES dApp (coming soon) can be used to create, view, and manage realms. You can also programmatically create realms directly from the smart contract by invoking the `createRealm` function.

### How do I integrate HyperVIBES into my protocol?

You can use HyperVIBES with any ERC-721 and ERC-20 token without having to write any code or deploy a contract by using the HyperVIBES dApp (coming soon) to manage realms, infuse NFTs, and claim tokens.

More direct integrations can be built by directly invoking the HyperVIBES smart contract from your protocol.
