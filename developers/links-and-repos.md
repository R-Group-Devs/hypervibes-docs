### Documentation

Beyond in-repo documentation and this docs site, Google Docs was used extensively during development:

* [Initial Product Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NvztqdMAyLERTPuX5uHSnq8f5G0YVRaxNsq5UaXhQEw) - Used to convey the idea internal among the Builder's Group and nail down the key concepts
* [Initial Vibe Brainstorm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7A-Pt48FBLlRODD6iA8TcQ5v22Jo5lIAdlcq\_EaQ4) - Nailing the vibe is critical. What should this protocol _feel_ like?
* [MVP Coordination](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dpMlzGeO4XfD6gBQoaTTXO2NxCCfA0hDYlTinJjCsfQ) - Helped track information across frontend and contract domains as development started
* [Protocol One-Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bpQfozAamT-zmYMm9aV0ao9KrBezCLTVEqM-\_UtHOGg) - Terse and straightforward info about the project that was shared externally to potential partners and internally to other working groups
