# ðŸ›¸ Overview

**HyperVIBES** is a public and trustless protocol for infusing tokens inside of any NFT.&#x20;

Anyone can create a realm, which is a fully configurable and isolated environment within the protocol. Depending on realm configuration, infused tokens may be claimed by the owner of the NFT over time.

[Rarible DAO](https://discord.gg/ZtZqH7nfgG) built this protocol as a [global public good](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/global-public-goods-and-the-protocol) to enrich the broader NFT ecosystem, encourage experimentation, and foster creative innovation.
