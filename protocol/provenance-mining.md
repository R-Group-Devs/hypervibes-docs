# ðŸ’Ž Provenance Mining

Provenance mining is a mechanism that allows an NFT to mine ERC-20 tokens over time that the owner of the NFT can claim. Unclaimed tokens stay within the NFT across sales or transfers.

### Infusion

**Infusion** is the process of staking ERC-20 tokens from your wallet into an NFT via HyperVIBES.&#x20;

Infused tokens are then mined by the NFT over time at a linear rate as configured in the realm. Mined tokens do not automatically go to the NFT owner's wallet, they must be "claimed" at some point (_see below_).

* Tokens immediately start mining on the same block they are infused.
* If the **require NFT is owned **constraint of the realm is `true`, the infuser must own the NFT being infused.
* If the **allow public infusion **constraint of the realm is `false`, the infuser must be on the list of allowed infusers for that realm.
* If the **allow all collections** constraint of the realm is `false`, the NFT being infused must be from a collection on the list of allowed collections for that realm.
* If the **allow multi infuse** constraint of the realm is `false`, an NFT can only be infused a single time for that realm.
* The amount being infused must be equal to or greater than the **min infusion amount** constraint set in the realm.
* If the infusion would result in a staked token balance for that NFT that is greater than the **max token balance **constraint for the realm, infused amount is clamped (limited) to the **max token balance** amount. If this clamped amount is less than **min infusion amount**, the infusion will fail.
* If the specified infuser is different than the address submitting the transaction, the infuser must have approved the sender as an [authorized proxy](proxies.md) ahead of time.

### Claiming

**Claiming** is the act of withdrawing mined tokens from an infused NFT to the NFT owner's wallet.&#x20;

Only mined tokens can be claimed, while un-mined tokens stay staked within the NFT. Unclaimed tokens stay within the NFT across sales or transfers.

* The total amount being claimed must be equal to or greater than the **min claim amount** constraint set in the realm.
* It is possible to claim less than the total claimable amount if desired.
* If the **allow public claiming** constraint of the realm is `false`, the claimer must be on the list of allowed claimers for that realm.
* One of the following conditions must always be true:
  * The claimer owns the NFT
  * The claimer has been approved (ERC-721 spec) to transfer the NFT by its owner
  * The claimer has been approved for all (ERC-721 spec) transfers by its owner
  * The claimer has been approved as an [authorized proxy](proxies.md) by the NFT owner
