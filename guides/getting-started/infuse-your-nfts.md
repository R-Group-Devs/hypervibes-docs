# ðŸ”¥ Infuse Your NFTs

Once you've created your realm, visit the INFUSE section via the top menu. You should see your newly created realm there:

If you don't see it, confirm the transaction went through and that you are still on the Goerli network. Sometimes it can take a few moments for TheGraph to index new realms as well.

Select your realm, and then select your collection:

Once you select your collection, type in Token ID **0** to infuse the token we minted previously:

Then input any amount of tokens you want to infuse, based on how you've configured your realm previously. These tokens will be transferred from your wallet into the NFT:

If this is your first infusion, you'll have to execute the **APPROVE** step as part of the standard ERC-20 approval flow:

Once the approval completes, you can infuse your NFT!

Your NFT is now infused!
