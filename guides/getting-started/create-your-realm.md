# ðŸ›¸ Create Your Realm

Previously, we have:

* Created our own ERC-20 token and minted some initial supply of tokens to our wallet
* Created our own ERC-721 NFT contract and minted a single NFT to our wallet

Now it's time to setup a HyperVIBES realm!

* [https://app.hypervibes.xyz](https://app.hypervibes.xyz)

Ensure you are still on the **Goerli Test Network**, and select the first card:

We will create our realm by inputting all the various configuration information. How you configure your realm is up to you!

We can leave admin blank for now, as we don't need to modify this realm. After press **NEXT**, add the NFT contract you deployed earlier as the **Allowed Collection: **

And set the **TOKEN ADDRESS** to the ERC-20 we deployed earlier (confirm the token symbol on the right of the input box):
