# ðŸ¤‘ Deploy a Token

Deploy your own ERC-20 token via CoinMechanic.&#x20;

* [https://coinmechanic.io](https://coinmechanic.io)

**If you already have a token you'd like to use, you can skip this step.**

This could be a social token, community token, governance token... or anything else you could imagine.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**You could also use any existing ERC-20 token** (such as $ENS, $RARI, or $USDC) for your realm.

Check your local jurisdiction's securities law before you get too crazy.
{% endhint %}

#### Deploy

Select **Build Token** from the CoinMechanic site, setup your token however you wish:

Once your token has been deployed, you can easily add it to your MetaMask. The initial supply will have been minted to your wallet:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notice the Contract address for your token** -- this is needed later when you configure your HyperVIBES realm.
{% endhint %}
