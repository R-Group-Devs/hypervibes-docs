# ðŸŽ¨ Deploy an NFT Contract

Deploy your own ERC-721 via wemint.art. If you already have minted NFTs or have your own contract, then you can skip this step.

* [https://wemint.art](https://wemint.art)

Controlling your own contract is a powerful way of establishing provenance around the pieces you mint.

{% hint style="info" %}
**You can use any existing ERC-721 NFTs as well**, HyperVIBES works across all minting platforms.

Depending on how you configure your realm, you don't even need to own the NFTs to infuse them.
{% endhint %}

#### Deploy

Make sure to **CONNECT** your wallet to the wemint.art app via the button in the top right, and ensure you are still on the **Goerli Test Network**. Provide some basic info to deploy your ERC-721 contract:

Once the contract is deployed:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notice the contract address once deployment has finished**, you'll need this later when setting up your realm.
{% endhint %}

#### Mint

Select **HOW TO** in wemint.art for a basic walkthrough of getting artwork into IPFS. Alternatively, you can use the following metadata URI:

* `ipfs://ipfs/QmPVEKvFEm9CHPzrKBuj7CPiEML9jKRUap7Lbpxu4tC1ce`

Once you have your metadata URI, select the **MINT** tab, provide the contract address and metadata URI:

Press **MINT! **and your NFT will be minted!
