# ðŸŒŽ Share Your Realm

In addition to the primary [Create Realm](create-your-realm.md), [Infuse NFTs](infuse-your-nfts.md), and [Claim Tokens](claim-tokens.md) UIs in HyperVIBES, there is a dedicated **Explore** section that can be used to view all realms and infused tokens, as well as share a direct link to a realm or NFT.

### Explore

Select the **EXPLORE** option from the top navigation menu of the HyperVIBES app, or select bottom **EXPLORE** button on the app home screen:

* [https://app.hypervibes.xyz](https://app.hypervibes.xyz)

Once there, you'll see a list of all realms:

Selecting a realm will take you to a page where all of the NFTs infused within a realm are visible:

Selecting an NFT will take you to the NFT detail page

Each of the above pages can be shared directly with others and viewed in a browser, even without a web3 wallet installed.
