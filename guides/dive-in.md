# üèÑ‚ôÄ Dive In

Welcome to **HyperVIBES**.** **

This page will walk you through using the HyperVIBES protocol on the **Goerli Test Network**:

* ü¶ä Get your browser setup with a web3 wallet ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io))
* üö∞ Request some test tokens on the Goerli network ([https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz))
* ü§ë Deploy your own ERC-20 token ([https://coinmechanic.io/](https://coinmechanic.io))&#x20;
* üé® Deploy a custom ERC-721 NFT contract ([https://wemint.art/](https://wemint.art))&#x20;
* üõ∏ Create a HyperVIBES realm ([https://app.hypervibes.xyz](https://app.hypervibes.xyz))
* üåà **Infuse your NFTs **&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You might have done some of these steps already. That's cool! This guide covers every point in the process so you can jump in and out where it makes senes.&#x20;

**HyperVIBES is all about experimentation.**&#x20;

### Overview

**HyperVIBES** is a public and trustless protocol for infusing tokens inside of any NFT.&#x20;

Infused tokens can be mined and claimed by the NFT owner over time.

Today, you're going to launch your own personal ERC-20 token and NFT contract using community-authored tools that are 100% free. Then, you're going to use the HyperVIBES protocol to create your own realm and infuse your NFTs with your token.

{% hint style="info" %}
**This walkthrough will be done on an Ethereum test network**, it won't cost any real money.

These same steps can be taken on any mainnet blockchain as well when you're ready to launch your project.
{% endhint %}

### Setup Your Wallet

If you haven't already, install MetaMask, an in-browser extension that allows you to connect to blockchain based decentralized applications, or "dApps":

* [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io)

MetaMask will allow you to interact with Ethereum-based networks and testnets, as well as networks like Polygon and Arbitrum.

{% hint style="info" %}
First time setting up metamask? [**Here is an official guide**](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask)
{% endhint %}

Make sure you have selected the **Goerli Test Network** from the network dropdown menu at the top of the MetaMask window.

### Drip Some Funds

A testnet "faucet" is a simple app that will send you tokens and NFTs on various test blockchains. You can skip this step if you already have tokens and have used the Goerli testnet before:

* [https://faucet.paradigm.xyz](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz)

In order to prevent abuse, you must log in with Twitter. After logging in, provide your wallet address from your MetaMask in the input to deliver test funds to your account.

### Deploy Your Token

Deploy your own ERC-20 token via CoinMechanic. If you already have a token you'd like to use, you can skip this step.

* [https://coinmechanic.io](https://coinmechanic.io)

This could be a social token, community token, governance token... or anything else you could imagine.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**You could also use any existing ERC-20 token** (such as ENS, MIST, or USDC) for your realm -- but check your local jurisdiction's securities law before you get too crazy.
{% endhint %}

#### Deploy

Select **Build Token** from the CoinMechanic site, setup your token however you wish:

Once your token has been deployed, you can easily add it to your MetaMask:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notice the Contract address for your token** -- this is needed later when you configure your HyperVIBES realm.
{% endhint %}

### Deploy Your NFT Contract

Deploy your own ERC-721 via wemint.art. If you already have minted NFTs or have your own contract, then you can skip this step.

* [https://wemint.art](https://wemint.art)

Controlling your own contract is a powerful way of establishing provenance around the pieces you mint.

{% hint style="info" %}
**You can use any existing ERC-721 NFTs as wel**l, HyperVIBES works across all minting platforms.

Depending on how you configure your realm, you don't even need to own the NFTs to infuse them.
{% endhint %}

#### Deploy

Make sure to **CONNECT** your wallet to the wemint.art app via the button in the top right, and ensure you are still on the **Goerli Test Network**. Provide some basic info to deploy your ERC-721 contract:
