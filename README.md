# 😎 Welcome

**HyperVIBES **is a public protocol that let's you infuse ERC-20 tokens into any ERC-721 NFT**.**&#x20;

Infused tokens can be mined and claimed by the NFT owner over time.

Create a fully isolated and independently configured HyperVIBES **realm** to run your own experiments or protocols without having to deploy a smart contract.

HyperVIBES is

* 🎁 Open Source
* 🥳 Massively Multiplayer
* 🌈 Public Infrastructure
* 💖 Free Forever

Feel free to use HyperVIBES however you want.

### Integrating

You can use HyperVIBES without having to write any code, but direct smart contract integrations can add infusion capabilities to your protocol or NFT project with just a few lines of code.

**If you're looking to build**, come hang in the [Rarible DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/ZtZqH7nfgG).&#x20;

We're working to make a habit of shipping fun and highly-composable decentralized software like HyperVIBES.
