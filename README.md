# 😎 Welcome

**HyperVIBES **is a public protocol from [**Rarible DAO**](https://discord.gg/ZtZqH7nfgG) that lets you infuse ERC-20 tokens into any ERC-721 NFT**.**&#x20;

Infused tokens can be mined and claimed by the NFT owner over time.

Create a fully isolated and independently configured HyperVIBES **realm** to run your own experiments or protocols without having to deploy a smart contract.

HyperVIBES is

* 🎁 Open Source
* 🥳 Massively Multiplayer
* 🌈 Public Infrastructure
* 🚀 Unstoppable and Censor-Proof
* 💖 Free Forever

**Feel free to use HyperVIBES in any way you want.**

### Integrating

You can use HyperVIBES without having to write any code, but direct smart contract integrations can rapidly add infusion capabilities to your protocol or NFT project.
